Hello Mr Jude, this is my repository for the OOP final project. For the project I made a classic brickbreaker game. In it features sound effects, pause function, and win-lose screens. I hope you like my project.


Notes:
The demo video is a silent video because my screen recording software wont pick up my mic, so I am very sorry for that.
